## 🛠️ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Gemini API key (configured in `.env` file)

### Quick Start
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```powershell
   pip install google-generativeai python-dotenv
   ```

2. **Ensure your `.env` file contains the API key:**
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```

3. **Run the complete demonstration:**
   ```powershell
   python task3_complete.py
   ```

## 🎨 Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques Demonstrated

### 1. **Role-Based Prompting** 🎭
```python
"You are an experienced technical hiring manager at a leading technology company..."
"Acting as the CTO of this healthcare AI startup..."
```
**Purpose**: Establishes clear persona and authority context for specialized responses

### 2. **Context-Specific Requirements** 🏥
- Healthcare AI startup scenario with regulatory considerations
- FDA and HIPAA compliance requirements
- Domain-specific challenges and ethical considerations
**Purpose**: Tailors questions to specific industry contexts and regulatory environments

### 3. **Structured Output Control** 📋
```python
"Format: Return exactly 3 questions, numbered 1-3"
"Clearly separate behavioral and technical questions"
```
**Purpose**: Ensures consistent, parseable responses with specific formatting

### 4. **Constraint-Based Prompting** 🚫
- "Avoid questions that can be easily googled or memorized"
- "Avoid generic questions that could apply to any profession"
- Clear negative instructions for better specificity
**Purpose**: Prevents generic responses and ensures domain-specific, thoughtful questions

### 5. **Multi-Criteria Assessment** ⚖️
- Technical competency + cultural fit evaluation
- Theoretical understanding + practical application balance
- Ethics + domain expertise integration
**Purpose**: Creates comprehensive evaluation frameworks beyond simple technical knowledge

## 📊 Sample Generated Results

### 🎯 Behavioral Questions (Generated via Prompt Engineering):
1. **Technical Decision-Making Under Pressure**: "Describe a time you were working on a project with a tight deadline and encountered a significant technical roadblock that threatened to derail the timeline..."

2. **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: "Tell me about a time you were part of a cross-functional team involving product managers, designers, QA, where you held a different technical viewpoint..."

3. **Technology Adaptation**: "Describe an instance where you had to quickly learn a new technology, framework, or programming language to complete a project..."

### ⚙️ Technical Questions (AI-Specialized):
1. **System Design**: "Design a real-time fraud detection system for credit card transactions with focus on AI/ML components, addressing concept drift and imbalanced data..."

2. **Algorithmic Problem-Solving**: "Develop a strategy to improve recommendations for cold start users in a hybrid recommendation system..."

3. **AI Ethics & Production**: "Address bias detection and mitigation in a loan approval model, considering regulatory landscape and patient safety..."

### 🚀 Advanced Context-Aware Example (Healthcare AI):
- **Behavioral**: Questions assessing healthcare domain awareness, regulatory compliance understanding
- **Technical**: AI model interpretability for clinical settings, HIPAA-compliant data processing

## 🏆 Key Innovations & Best Practices

1. **🎯 Multi-Layered Prompt Architecture**: Combines role definition, context specification, requirements listing, and constraint setting in a structured hierarchy

2. **🏥 Domain-Aware Question Generation**: Industry-specific considerations (healthcare, fintech) with regulatory compliance awareness (FDA, HIPAA)

3. **⚖️ Ethical AI Integration**: Built-in bias detection, fairness assessment, and responsible AI practices in technical questions

4. **📈 Scalable Prompt Framework**: Adaptable structure for different roles, industries, and experience levels

5. **🔍 Experience Level Calibration**: Questions appropriately targeted for mid to senior-level candidates with depth indicators

6. **🤝 Stakeholder Communication Focus**: Emphasis on explaining complex AI concepts to non-technical audiences (medical professionals, regulators)
