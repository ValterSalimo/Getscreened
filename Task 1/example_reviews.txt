This movie was absolutely brilliant! The direction was flawless and the acting was superb.
What a waste of time and money. The plot made no sense and the characters were one-dimensional.
It was okay. Had some good moments but overall just average.
The cinematography was beautiful but the pacing was too slow for my taste.
A masterpiece that will be remembered for generations to come!
I can't believe I paid money to see this terrible excuse for a film.
The first half was slow, but the second half more than made up for it with excellent plot twists.
The actors tried their best with a mediocre script.
While not perfect, the film managed to keep me entertained throughout.
One of the worst movies I've seen in years. Avoid at all costs.
